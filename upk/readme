This is the tool to generate the OSD upgrading package.

1. Compile the tool
   gcc crc32.c package.c -o osdpkg

2. Copy tool to neuros-bsp/images

3. Create upk
   ./osdpkg nh [upk_desc] [upk_name] [bins ...]

You can choose to either generate a full package that includes each
binary or a package just for that part that has been changed.

Example:
<1> To create a upk by including everything
   ./osdpkg nh "upk by yada_yada on 2006-10-18" r3.upk env.img
u-boot.bin uImage root.cramfs

<2> To create a upk by just including the rootfs
   ./osdpkg nh "upk by blah_blah on 2006-10-18" r3.upk root.cramfs
